The project was carried out in the second year of college and aims to develop a Java application for the management and visualization of kitchen equipment, with an emphasis on refrigerators and refrigeration units. Its aim is to provide an interactive platform for users to explore the various features and options available for these equipments, thereby facilitating the selection and purchase process.

Classes are structured to represent this equipment, including characteristics such as brand, capacity, dimensions and other relevant details.

  • The "Fridge" class is defined to model refrigerators, with attributes such as noise level and the presence of No Frost technology.

  • The "CombinaFrigorifica" class is used to represent refrigerators, having similar specifications and additional specific attributes, such as power and the presence of an ice dispenser.

  • The "KitchenElements" class serves as a base class for both types of equipment, providing common attributes and access methods for them.

  • The "TestClass" class contains methods for populating the lists of Refrigerator and CombineRefrigeration objects with test data, thus providing a basis for testing and demonstrating the functionality of the project.

The purpose of the project is to illustrate how various kitchen appliances can be managed and interacted with through a Java application, using object-oriented programming principles and a well-defined modular structure. It aims to provide users with an efficient and intuitive experience in exploring and evaluating kitchen appliances, contributing to making informed decisions in the purchasing process.
