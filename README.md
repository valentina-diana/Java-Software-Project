The project aims to develop a Java application for managing and visualizing kitchen appliances, with a focus on refrigerators and fridge-freezers. It aims to provide an interactive platform for users to explore the various features and options available for these appliances, thus facilitating the selection and purchase process.

The classes are structured to represent these appliances, including features such as brand, capacity, dimensions, and other relevant details.

•	The "Frigider" class is defined to model refrigerators, with attributes such as noise level and the presence of No Frost technology.

•	The "CombinaFrigorifica" class is used to represent fridge-freezers, with similar specifications and additional specific attributes, such as power and the presence of an ice dispenser.

•	The "ElementeBucatarie" class serves as a base class for both types of appliances, providing common attributes and access methods for them.

•	The "TestClass" contains methods for populating lists of Frigider and CombinaFrigorifica objects with test data, thus providing a basis for testing and demonstrating the functionality of the project.

The purpose of the project is to illustrate how various kitchen appliances can be managed and interacted with through a Java application, using object-oriented programming principles and a well-defined modular structure. It aims to provide users with an efficient and intuitive experience in exploring and evaluating kitchen appliances, contributing to making informed decisions in the purchasing process.
